Streamlit app that trains an LBPH face recognizer on a local dataset, detects faces with MediaPipe/OpenCV, and applies aggressive real-time image distortions (noise, pixel/block scrambling, feature destruction, adversarial patterns, color transforms) to disrupt recognition. Live camera feed, controls to start/stop recognition and evasion, and session metrics.

Dataset and `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` are included in the repository.
